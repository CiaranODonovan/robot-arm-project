# robot-arm-project

This project is an educational work in progress that has mainly served as a self directed learning experience in electronics and CAD mechanical design. 
The code provided is very simplistic prototyping for esp8266 web browser controls over a WiFi network while I experimented with different components, and will be updated with more comprehensive control & functionality in the future.

Specifications:

6 Degree of Freedom robot arm printed with PLA, 0.2mm, 15-25% infill.

Requires 6 sg90/mg90 servo motors with the screws/horns provided.

Additionally an M2.5 screw with a larger head than provided with servos is required to secure the gripper to the wrist servo, and 5 M3 screws for the gripper itself.

3 stocks must be printed.

each other component need only be printed once.

The arm can function without load with the files provided, but for any load the base should be secured to something heavier to maintain balance via the 4 holes requiring M2.5 bolts.

foam padding for the finger tips is optional but recommended as the compliance and coefficient of friction greatly helps the small micro servos.
