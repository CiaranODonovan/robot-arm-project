# robot-arm-project

This project is an educational work in progress that has mainly served as a self directed learning experience in electronics and CAD mechanical design. 
The code provided is very simplistic control prototyping with an esp8266 (NodeMCU variant). It currently uses web browser controls over a WiFi network while I experimented with different components. Code will be updated with more comprehensive control & functionality in the future.

Specifications & instructions:

6 Degrees of Freedom robot arm printed with PLA, 0.2mm, 15-25% infill.

Requires 6 sg90/mg90 servo motors including the screws/horns provided.

A M2.5 screw with a large head is required to secure the gripper to the wrist component, and 5 M3 screws for the gripper.

4 stocks for the levers must be printed.

Print each other component only once.

Each servo connected to a lever utilizes the provided horns and screws to mount the open side rails.

The arm can function without load with the files provided, but for any load the base should be secured to a heavier base material via the 4 base holes, each requiring M2.5 bolts, to maintain stability.

foam padding for the finger tips is optional but recommended as the compliance & friction greatly help the small micro servos maintain continuous grip.
